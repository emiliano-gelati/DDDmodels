# Calibration tools for DDD


## 1. Requirements

Julia version and libraries are defined in `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml`:
See [Pkg documentation](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/#Using-someone-else's-project)
for how to recreate the Julia environment to calibrate DDD.


## 2. How to set up and run a calibration

To calibrate DDD on a set of catchments using 10 parallel threads, run

`julia --project=.. --threads 11 calibrate_multiple_catchments.jl <path/to/settings.toml>`

where the last argument is the path to a TOML file (for example `settings/calibration_251120.toml`)
containing the following entries:

- `root_output`: absolute path to the folder under which all calibration output will be stored.
- `path_catchments_list`: path to the text file with the IDs of the catchments to be calibrated,
  where lines starting with `#` are ignored (example: `settings/catchments/catchments_251120.txt`).
- `path_parameter_ranges`: path to the TOML file defining upper and lower bounds for the hydrologic
  parameters to be calibrated, where the `[default]` section is compulsory; and sections for
  individual catchments can be added by using catchment IDs for headers, where custom ranges for
  individual parameters can be set
  (example: `settings/parameter_ranges/parameter_ranges_251120.toml`).
- `template_path_ptq`: template path to the PTQ (precipitation, temperature and discharge) CSV file
  for each catchment, where `<CATCHMENT>` and `<PERIOD>` are replaced by the catchment ID and
  the abbreviation for each period (e.g. `kal` for calibration) in the function `pathsPTQ`.
- `template_path_inipar`:template path to the files with initial values for the full parameter set
  defining each catchment (example: files in `/hdata/hmdata01/DDD_calibration/BestPrimo2025/`).
- `spinup`: model spinup time (days).
- `steps_max`: maximum number of steps used by the optimisation algorithm.
- `periods`: section defining names (arbitrary) and abbreviations (must match the tokens used to
  replace `<PERIOD>` in `template_path_ptq`) for each period the model is run on.


## 3. Output

For each catchment, results are written in folder `root_output/<CATCHMENT>/`, where the `initial/`
and `calibrated/` subfolders contains output from DDD runs with initial and calibrated parameter
values, respectively.

In each subfolder, the following files are written by
`../DDDFunctions/DDDAllTerrain22012024.jl`:

- `r2_<PERIOD>.csv`: row file with NSE, KGE, bias and hydrologic parameter values.
- `series_<PERIOD>.csv`: DDD output time series.

Additional items in the `calibrated/` subfolder:

- `parameters.csv`: new full parameter set defining the catchment, including the newly calibrated
  hydrologic parameters.
- `log/`: all parameter sets, and corresponding scores, tried by the optimisation algorithm and
  logged in separate files (one file per computational thread to avoid concurrent access).
  Each row has the same format as the `r2_<PERIOD>.csv` files described above.


## 4. Restart

The presence of the empty file `root_output/<CATCHMENT>/done` means that calibration ran
until the stopping criterion for that catchment: If the calibration script is re-run, this
catchment will be skipped.

## 5. Possible improvements

0. Diagnostic plots for each catchment: time series, parameters, etc.
1. Redefine DDDAll... as made up of 2 functions: f1 loading PTQ time series, and f2 doing the rest
   taking PTQ series among its input. To calibrate a catchment, f1 would be called only once and
   f2 would be iterated over by the search algorithm.
2. Use TypedTables instead of DataFrames to read input from CSV files and to pass data to the model,
   to ensure type stability (types of DataFrame columns are unknown a priori to the compiler)
3. Specify which parameters should be calibrated and which have a fixed value in settings,
   instead of using collapsed ranges, to reduce the formal number of parameters.
4. Check that functions are type-stable to avoid performance losses.
5. Profile DDD code to look for performance bottlenecks.
6. Test if using views instead of slices improves performance by reducing memory allocations.
7. Sensitivity analysis (e.g. [GlobalSensitivity.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/GlobalSensitivity/stable/))
8. Use julia 1.12 and [workspaces](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/creating-packages/#Test-specific-dependencies)
   to define test- and calibration-specific dependencies.
